## Key Contributions

IntrAgent introduces **IntraView**, a new task for content-grounded information retrieval from a provided scientific paper, and proposes an LLM agent that mimics human literature reading through structure-aware section ranking and iterative evidence gathering. To evaluate this setting, the work presents **IntraBench**, a 315-instance benchmark across five STEM domains on which IntrAgent improves average cross-domain accuracy by **13.2%** over strong RAG and literature-agent baselines.

- Defines **IntraView**, a new task for faithful information retrieval from a provided scientific paper rather than from external search.
- Introduces **IntrAgent**, a specialized LLM agent that follows a human-like workflow: identify promising sections, extract evidence, and stop when support is sufficient.
- Develops two core mechanisms for the task: **hierarchy-preserving section ranking** and **iterative reading with information sufficiency checking**.
- Builds **IntraBench**, the first benchmark for this setting, covering 315 instances across five impactful STEM domains.

## IntraView Task

IntraView is formulated as a content question answering problem over a full scientific paper. Given a literature document *C* and a research-driven query *Q*, the system must return an answer *A* that is accurate, concise, and explicitly grounded in the provided paper.

Compared with standard content QA, the task is harder because scientific papers are long, structurally complex, and filled with domain-specific terminology. The relevant evidence may appear anywhere in the document, may require cross-referencing multiple sections, and may sometimes be absent entirely, making hallucination control central to the task.

## IntrAgent Method

### Stage 1: Section Ranking

IntrAgent first parses section titles and preserves the paper hierarchy so the model can reason over the document as a structured artifact rather than a flat list of chunks. The LLM then ranks sections by likely relevance to the question, producing a reordered reading path.

This hierarchy-aware step is designed to better align scientific questions with the parts of a paper most likely to contain supporting evidence.

### Stage 2: Iterative Reading

The agent reads the ranked sections sequentially, extracts anchored details such as terminology, measurements, results, and comparisons, and stores them in short-term memory for answer synthesis.

After each reading step, IntrAgent performs an explicit **information sufficiency check**. If the evidence is still incomplete, it continues reading; otherwise it stops and synthesizes a grounded answer.

## IntraBench Benchmark

To evaluate IntraView, the paper introduces **IntraBench**, the first benchmark specifically designed for literature-grounded information retrieval. It contains **315 test instances** derived from expert-authored questions paired with research papers.

The benchmark spans five high-impact domains and is intended to capture technical depth, conceptual complexity, and domain-specific phrasing encountered in real literature review workflows.

Domains: Physics, Earth Science, Public Health, Engineering, Material Science

Questions are organized around four research-oriented categories described in the paper: study subject and experimental setup, data characteristics and collection, technical approach and details, and conclusions and results. Evaluation is performed through LLM-grounded multiple-choice mapping to handle synonyms, abbreviations, and scientific terminology variation.

Figure 2. An example of IntrAgent executing a question-paper pair from IntraBench. For an input question Q regarding paper C, vanilla RAG fails to extract the correct chunk, resulting in an incorrect answer. In contrast, IntrAgent ranks the sections through reasoning and retrieves the correct details that pass the sufficiency check in the first iteration, leading to a correct answer. Details for section ranking and sufficiency check are also presented.

## Experiments and Results

The experiments compare IntrAgent against a broad set of RAG-based retrieval systems and literature-oriented agents, including vanilla RAG variants, contextual RAG, DRAGIN, R2AG, LongRAG, LUMOS, PaperQA2, Agentic-Hybrid-RAG, and SciMaster.

On IntraBench, IntrAgent sets a new state of the art across all five domains and seven backbone LLMs. Reported average accuracies include **70.0%** with GPT-4o, **75.8%** with GPT-4.1, **74.4%** with DeepSeek-R1, **73.4%** with o3, **73.8%** with o4-mini, **75.9%** with Gemini-2.5 Pro, and **68.8%** with Llama-3.1-70B.

The paper attributes these gains to two main design choices: hierarchy-aware section ranking and the sufficiency check that stops reading once evidence is complete. In contrast, flat RAG pipelines often inject irrelevant chunks, while literature agents designed for online search degrade into static retrieval pipelines when constrained to a provided paper.
